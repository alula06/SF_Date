# SF DATE

SF DATE is an internet application that I developed with a few group members for a class project. It runs on Ruby on Rails, and was developed to act as a social bonding site for San Francisco State University students. The site includes the ability to create an account, log-in, add friends, post a status, and add events to a global calendar available to all registered users.
